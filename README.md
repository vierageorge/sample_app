# Ruby on Rails Sample Application

This is the sample application that I'll be building to learn how to build webapps using Ruby on Rails.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

2. Migrate database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

3. Run test suite to verify everything's OK:

```
$ rails test
```

4. If test suite runs correcty, you're ready to launch the development server:

```
$ rails server
```
